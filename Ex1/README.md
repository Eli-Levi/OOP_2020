Weighted and undirected graph library
===

This project implements the Dijkstra algorithm on a weighted and undirected graph.

The user can create a graph, add/removes nodes, connect them and designate a positive value as a weight to the edge and more.

Using the Dijkstra algorithm, you can check if the graph is connected, what is the shortest path between any two nodes (if the graph is connected) and what is the distance of said path.

In addition, the user can save and load the graphs he creates.
