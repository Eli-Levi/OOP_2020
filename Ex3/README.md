Ariel OOP course: Exersice 3 is about directed weighted graphs in python while comparing diffrent functions from the older java exercise and NetworkX graph code.

## **Description**
 directed weighted graphs with test wired in python

### **Terminology**
Node - a single point on the graph on which the trainers spawn.

Edge - a line which connects two between two distinct nodes and on which the pokemons randomly spawn

Path - a sequence of nodes and edges starting at a source node and ending at the chosen destination.

Weight - the cost it takes to traverse any given edge.

Dijkstra - is an algorithm that finds the shortest path between a starting node and an end node, taking in to account the weights between the nodes.

Breadth-First-Search (BFS)

## **Installing**
------
All you need to do is clone this repository and you'll have all the needed files that implement Dijkstra's algorithm including a JAR file that will run for you the server.

Here are the command lines you need to run in order to clone and use this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Eli-Levi/OOP_2020/edit/main/Ex3.git

You're all done!
